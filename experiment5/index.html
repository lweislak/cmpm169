			<h1>Experiment 5 - 3D Graphics</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<div id="canvas-container">
					<!-- canvas will be added here -->
				</div>
                <div class="fullscreen-box">
                    <button id="fullscreen">Fullscreen</button>
                </div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Press and hold a mouse click anywhere on the canvas in order to create a cube. The cube grows as the mouse is held down.
					Once the mouse button is released the cube direction and speed is randomly generated; it moves across the screen
					and bounces when it hits the bottom of the screen.
				</p>
				<p>
					The inspiration was the ending screen of Solitaire where the cards move and bounce across the screen one by one.
				</p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The experiment utilizes WebGL to draw and rotate the cubes. The draw function does not erase the previous paths of the cubes 
					in order to create a trail behind them as they move. The rotate function is called from within the draw function and the
					angle of the cubes is increased by 0.1 in order to create the animation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once a cube is off screen, checked with the size of the canvas and an offset to account for the size of the cube, the array 
					that holds the cubes is spliced to remove the object. The object is found in the array using the indexOf function.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> I am very happy with the experiment and I feel like I achieved what I had originally envisioned. I have a lot of nostalgia 
					for the digital Solitaire that used to come with a fresh install of Windows. This experiment brings back memories of playing on my 
					family computer with my dad.
				</p>
				<p>
					The most difficult, time consuming part of the experiment was understanding the WebGL axis. Once I had a handle on it everything 
					else came pretty easily. I wanted to add color to the cubes in order to create more visual interest, but the black and white 
					looks nice. It almost makes it look M.C. Escher-esque after enough cubes are created.
