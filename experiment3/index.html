				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					I wanted to recreate a snow storm. The swirling snow moves in all different directions and particles can clump together and break away.
					The slower a particle is moving, the darker the color will be. This gives the snow dimension and makes some particles seem farther away.
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					The code utilized <a href="https://eater.net/boids">Boid's Flocking Algorithm</a> which has three rules: coherence, separation, and alignment.
					Essentially particles will gradually move towards other particles, will not completely overlap with other particles,
					and try to move in the same direction speed as other particles.
					The particles have a radius around them that will apply the three rules depending on particles that are inside of it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each of the three rules has their own function. Each snow particle is an object which has a position, velocity, and acceleration. These variables
					are what directly control the particles because they are used in each of the functions to calculate the steering force (how the particles are moved)
					which is then applied to the acceleration in order to move it (force accumulation).
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					I flip flopped around with different ideas. At first I wanted to persue using noise since I had never worked with it before,
					but I didn't have any inspiration and felt it wasn't worth the trouble. I then pivoted to utilizing the flocking algorithm.	
					After implementing the basic tutorial found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhjuuHl6qHM">here</a> 
					I noticed that the result looked like falling snow and I ended up running with that idea.
				</p>
				<p>
					The greatest difficulty was finding a good algorithm to determine the color. I tried many methods, some of my own and some I found online,
					before settling on one that I think achieved the look I was envisioning.
				</p>
				<p>
					I like the 3-dimensional look that the greyscale particles have. At first I was going to use other colors, but it was annoying to convert the 
					distance floats into hex codes so I decided to lean fully into the snow idea. Overall, I think it was a good choice.
