				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I was inspired by (<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/M_6_1_03">this generative work</a>) 
					since I liked the visual of a graph. I wanted to add animation; something resembing electricity following
					a path in a piece of computer hardware. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used some code from the generative art piece (linked above) as a starting point.
				The largest change was animating the nodes to follow the edge path when they were created. I calculated a random angle and distance from the clicked node,
			  placed the new node, and then recalculated the angle using the Math.atan() function in order to move them. I also rounded the angles and locations of the 
				nodes to the hundredths place to account for the slightly offset location when moving the nodes from the origin to their final location.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, I am happy with the way my experiment turned out and I feel like I accomplished in creating what I had envisioned.
				Working with the draw function was the most difficult part of the project. I spent a few hours getting the nodes to move correctly and stop at their final location.
				I also tried to write readable code as I progressed. Placing the nodes randomly was easy and only took some minor tweaking to get it to look how I wanted.
