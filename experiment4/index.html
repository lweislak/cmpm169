				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					I wanted to create aesthetically pleasing wind chimes that play a sound and glow when clicked on.
					The heights and colors of the chimes are generated at random.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also added fireflies in the background to add to the ambiance and create a outdoor garden atmosphere.
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					The wind chimes are all class objects that contain their position, color, and unique chime sound effect. 
					I used beginShape and endShape to draw the chimes and fill in their respective colors.
					They are also spread out evenly across the x-axis using this function: (scale*0.5)+spacing+(i-1)*(scale+spacing),
					where scale = padding - spacing - (spacing / numberOfChimes) and i is the current number of chimes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fireflies use some of the same code from Experiment 3, like looping particles around the edges of the screen and movement.
					They also draw from <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/dt2307/sketches/NAaFMQ7hc">this</a> project that I found. They blink at different rates and have varying brightness.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					I worked on this experiment by myself and used code from all credited sources. Overall, I am very happy with the result from the experiment. 
					Like the previous experiment, I ended up pivoting early on once I found a more inspiring work. One highlight of the process was getting the blur effect to work as intended. 
					It seemed too simple and obvious to work at the time and was surprised to see that it worked just like I wanted it to.
				</p>
				<p>
					One small difficulty was drawing the chimes during my first iteration by using the line() function. 
					I had tried to draw them this way before I switched to using beginShape() and endShape(). 
					Trying to figure out the vertices and making it look right took a lot of trial and error.
					In the end Iâ€™m glad I switched since I knew I would have difficulty filling in the shapes with unique colors if I was only using line().
