				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment was inspired by ambigrams, words that are still readable from different perspectives. Click anywhere 
					on the canvas in order to generate a random word that will rotate along the x-axis. It can still be read, even when upside down.
				</p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I utilized the Lake Reflection font on each word. I originally wanted to rotate the words along the y-axis instead of the x-axis because 
					that seemed to be what most ambigrams do. However, that would mean that I would have to create original ambigrams for each generated word. It was much 
					more reasonable to use a font that can adapt to any word that I apply it to.
				</p>
				<p>
					I store about 2,000 words in a .txt file within the experiment folder and then splice a word from that file used the built in random function. The green and blue 
					parts of the RGB color for each word are randomized as well.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I was the only contributor to the experiment unless otherwise credited. I am happy with the result of the experiment. 
					The font does a lot of heavy lifting because without it I would simply be displaying and rotating words. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The most difficult part of the experiment was trying to find inspiration. 
					I kept starting and restarting the experiment using different sources of inspiration, but I would never make it very far. 
					After finding ambigrams and using those as a jumping off point the rest of the project was pretty straightforward. 
					Itâ€™s not a complicated or technical experiment. 
					However, it still is visually interesting because of the colors and amount of variation in the words.
